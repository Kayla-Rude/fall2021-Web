              <h3>General Info</h3>
              <p>
                  My name is Kayla Rude and I am currently a senior in the computer science department at CU Boulder. 
                  I am finally back in Boulder after spending the past year and a half back in my hometown in northern Illinois.
                  I grew up in the Chicagoland area and perpetually remain on the hunt for decent pizza in Boulder (no Cosmos is not decent pizza). 
                  I have a variety of hobbies all of which tap into my creative side. I am passionate about mental health and 
                  disability advocacy. I am an avid photographer and am an LA for the image class within ATLAS. 
                  I think there is something incredibly powerful about crafting an image or piece of content that shares your unique perspective of the world. 
                  Finally the hobby that I am most passionate about is nail art. Over the course of the pandemic doing nail art and sharing it with my Instagram community has helped me feel connected. 
              </p>
              <h3>Goals for the class</h3>
              <p>
                My goal for this class is to gain a better understanding of front end web development. 
                I just finished software development and methods so I have an advanced knowledge of database systems and learned a lot of HTML, javascript, and CSS in that class. 
                My passion lies in creating accessible technology. I want to work on front end development and creating interfaces accessible to everyone.
                I hope that this class will touch on some accesibility content and pushes students to consider how their designes will be received by the disabled community.
