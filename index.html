        <h1>Service Dogs</h1>
        <p>
            Service dogs perform a variety of tasks to aid their handlers in their daily lives. 
            There are two main types of service dogs: psychiatric service dogs and mobility/physical disability service dogs.
            Service dogs are often trained by professional trainers at a training school, but service dogs can be trained by their handler.

        <h3>History of Working Dogs</h3>
        <hr class="solid">
        <p>
            Humanity has a long history of working with dogs. There are records of hunters working with dogs as early as 600 B.C. 
            Law enforcment and military operations often make use of working dogs to find bombs, drugs, or money among many other illicit or dangerous goods. 
            Service dogs are a specific type of working dog that perform specific tasks to mitigate a persons disability. 
            The first record of a service dog is in 1750. A Parisian hospital for the blind began the first formal instruction of guide dogs.
            Taking their lead from the hospitial many people began to train dogs for the blind. We now know that guide dogs often have the potential to change
            a blind persons life and allow them to lead a more independent life. Today there are service dogs for a variety of conditions PTSD, anxiety, autism, and ADHD.

        <h3>Psychiatric Service Dogs</h3>
        <hr class="solid">
        <p>
            Psychiatric service dogs are dogs trained to help someone with a mental or neurological disability. 
            For example a service dog for someone with PTSD is considered a psychiatric service animal. 
            Psychiatric service animals are often confused with emotional support animals; it is important to note that they are not the same thing.
            A service animal is trained to perform at least one specific task to help mitigate the symptoms of the handlers disability. 
            Emotional support animals, though often provide important comfort for those with disabilities are not formally trained in any specific tasks. 
            Psychiatric service dogs often provide a sense of security and safety that make the handler feel more comfortable and confident in the world.

        <h3>Interacting With Service Dogs</h3>
        <hr class="solid">
        <p>
            When someone has a service dog it is important that you do not distract the dog in anyway.
            The dog is not a pet! They are there to perform specific tasks for their owner and distracting the animal from their job could have life threatining consequences.
            When you see a service dog you should pretend it is not there. 
            The following should never be done without the handlers express permission:
            <ol>
                <li>Pet the dog</li>
                <li>Play with the dog</li>
                <li>Talk too or make noises at the dog</li>
                <li>Make eye contact with the dog</li>
                <li>Feed the dog</li>
            </ol>
            As a general rule do not mess with any working animal unless the handler has given you permission.
